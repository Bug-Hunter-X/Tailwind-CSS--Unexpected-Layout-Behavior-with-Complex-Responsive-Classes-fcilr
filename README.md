# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Layout Behavior
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to unexpected behavior with complex responsive class combinations. Specifically, the combination of `flex`, `flex-col`, and `md:flex-row` can sometimes lead to unexpected layout issues.

## Bug Description
The issue stems from the order in which Tailwind CSS applies these modifiers.  When the screen size is below the `md` breakpoint, the element is a flex column.  Once the screen size goes above `md` breakpoint, the order of precedence and how these modifiers work together can sometimes cause unexpected results. 

## Solution
The solution involves carefully examining how your responsive modifiers interact.  It might require either reorganizing the classes or using a more specific approach to target different screen sizes and ensure they align with the desired outcome.
